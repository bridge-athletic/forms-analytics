KPIs:


1. Athletes parameters (7 total) over time & compare with each other.
2. Team parameters (7 total) over time & compare with each other.
3. Athlete parameter vs team parameter over time.
4. Form score for athlete over time.
5. Form score for team over time.
6. Compliance for athlete over time.
7. Compliance for team over time.
8. ACWR for athlete parameters.
9. ACWR for team parameters.


Other ideas:
- can we see if any of the individual parameters influence their overall score more or less?
- do the overall and form score show the same thing? Probably they should right?

Notes:

- hard to understand the data when we plot all of it, should limit it to one year // do this next




Notes:
- commit more often with smaller chunks of code
- sum for the team 
- fix the average for replicated pieces
- plot hours of sleep 


Individual users:


- organize the functions into a class
- main file to start it up
